Title: Hello World!

This is my first post on my new minimalist blog. I'm excited to share my thoughts with the world.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. It's designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats.

Here are a few things I like about it:

*   It's easy to write and read.
*   It's clean and uncluttered.
*   It focuses on the content, not the presentation.

I look forward to writing more soon!
